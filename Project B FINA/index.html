                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p> Scientist : Lunam Crustulam , Starwater Beach / May 22nd, 2022 </p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p> Starsipede, a very distant relative to the Scolopendra native to Earth. They share similar characteristics, only in terms of movement. Every other characteristic is alien when compared to the Scolopendra, whos origins are from Earth.     </p>

            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p> Although Earth is not their optimal habitat, the Stella Scolopendra have managed to fit into an ecosystem with no issues. You can find the Stella Scolopendra on beaches, particualarly around cave and rock-like formations. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p> Big beady eyes, can be considered disturbing to some, to others-- oddly fascinating. The Starsipedes' have eyes that are seemingly almost disproportionate to the size of it's head. Looks vaguely similar to a Scolopendra, however, the Starsipede has a ghastly white exoskeleton. Additonally, they have been said to have a radiating glow under the proper circumstances. </p>

                The Starsipede is an extraterrestrial species belonging to the genus Scolopendra. It is one of the very few extraterresrial species that can be found on Earth. They have been previously thought to have been harmless, but some recent instances have shown otherwise. Most recently, Starsipedes, when interacted in their habitats on Earth, they become highly defensive of their space. There have been cases of peope coming in contact with Starsipedes and saying that they get visual hallucinations, this is thought to be a way for Starsipedes to defend their territory. In the moonlight, that is where Starsipedes thrive, finally coming out of their habitat and basking in the moonlight. Although the morning interactions for many some people have been heard to be bad, people have had positive interactions with Starsipedes at night. If you hold up bioluminesence in their field of view, they will thoroughhly enjoy it, and it also allows for them to glow brighter.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Although Starsipedes are generally harmless once you know the conditions in which they are not to be disturbed, always use caution when interacting with the species. At the end of the day, they are still an extraterrestrial and invasive species, and we are not fully aware of what they are capable of. As of right now, the existence of Starsipedes on Earth can be deemed to not be a major threatening issue. Happy spotting!
